<h1> <mark>"Boog" aka My Bestie For the Restie!!<3</mark> </h1>
     <p> Many years ago, I met Austin. We met quite unexpectedly but there was an instant connection. Now, I am happy to call him my best friend. He is the person that I know I can confide in 100% without feeling judged or scared. I am so grateful for him and now I'd like to share his amazingness with the world!!

      <h3> <u>Who is he?</u> </h3>
      <p> Austin is a 6'0, 18 year old, gentle giant. He loves playing videogames like R6, Rocket League, and Session. He also loves biking, motorcycling, and playing sports with his little brother. 
        He has a heart of gold and contains so much love for all. Although, I have to keep him in check sometimes! Currently, he is studying to become a CRNA (<strong><em>something I could never do</em></strong>). I try my best to help him with his homework, but I often get lost in the complex science terms. 
      
  
      <h3> <u> Why "Boog"?</u></h3>
      <p> When Austin was a kid, his favorite movie was <strong><em> Open Season</em></strong>. He loved it so much that his mom decided to start calling him Boog, after the main character. After a while, it caught on amongst his immediate family. It is a nickname that they all still use to this day. As I got closer with austin and his family, I began calling him it as well. I don't think it's a name that'll ever leave him.
